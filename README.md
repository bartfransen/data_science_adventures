A collection of personal projects in Data Science

- BrainStation Capstone Project: Final project I did for the full-time Data Science 12 week bootcamp at Brainstation Vancouver in Spring 2019. Taking data from sales quotes in MS Word documents, I trained a regression model to predict the price based on certain features. The notebook describes the entire process, from scraping the data out of MS Word documents to deploying a web-app that exposes the model and makes it useable.
